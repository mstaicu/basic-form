#A form experiment
A simple form experiment on top of an overlay using nothing but Javascript (no libraries or frameworks) and CSS (no preprocessors) from [@mdstaicu](https://twitter.com/mdstaicu).

To run this example you should serve the files from a HTTP server. You can use the Python Simple HTTP Server by invoking it at the root of this project
```bash
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
